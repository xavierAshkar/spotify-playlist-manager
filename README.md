# Spotify Playlist Manager ðŸŽµ

A modern, responsive web app for curating and organizing Spotify playlists with enhanced control and personalization beyond the native Spotify app. This project focuses on creating a clean, minimal, and emotionally engaging user experience â€” a playground for leveling up my UI/UX design skills while also strengthening my full-stack development abilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Iâ€™m building this app as part of my journey to become a **UI/UX designer and front-end developer** who also understands backend systems. By combining React, Tailwind CSS, and Spotifyâ€™s Web API, Iâ€™m aiming to deliver an application thatâ€™s both functional and enjoyable to use â€” applying emotional design principles to make the experience fun, intuitive, and memorable.
